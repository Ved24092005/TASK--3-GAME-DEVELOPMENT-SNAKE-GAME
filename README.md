## DISCRIPTION : As part of my 4-week internship , I worked on building a File Management Tool using C++. This tool is designed to provide a basic yet powerful interface for managing files through command-line operations. It helps users perform various file-related tasks such as creation, deletion, renaming, moving, and listing files in a specified directory.

The main focus of the project was to enhance my understanding of file handling and directory operations in C++, and to practice writing efficient and user-friendly console applications.
